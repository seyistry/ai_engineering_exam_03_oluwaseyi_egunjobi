Concise Report: Wine Quality Modeling and Deployment
1. Overview of Approach

This project focused on building and deploying a machine learning model to classify white wines by quality using the UCI White Wine dataset. After cleaning and exploring the data, I designed a complete pipeline—from preprocessing to model deployment—aimed at helping producers understand and enhance wine quality.

2. Data Preparation

Cleaning: Removed duplicate entries and confirmed there were no missing values.

Transformation: Converted numeric quality scores into four intuitive categories: Best (9–8), Good (7–6), Average (5), and Bad (4–3).

Scaling: Applied MinMax scaling to normalize feature ranges and improve model performance.

Splitting: Used a stratified train/test split to preserve the class balance for fair evaluation.

3. Modeling and Evaluation

Several models were tested—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes.
Random Forest delivered the best balance of performance and interpretability. The model was fine-tuned using RandomizedSearchCV and saved as model.pkl for deployment, along with the corresponding scaler.

Key Metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score were used to assess performance.

Precision: Reflects how often predicted “Good” or “Best” wines truly are of that quality — essential for pricing and brand trust.

Recall: Measures how many actual “Bad” wines are correctly identified — critical for quality control.

F1-score: Balances both and was the primary performance metric, especially given the class imbalance.

Interpretation:
The model showed stronger precision for “Good” wines than for “Bad” ones, meaning when it labels a wine as “Good,” it’s usually correct. However, slightly higher recall for “Bad” wines means the system is cautious in it errs on the side of catching poor-quality batches, which is valuable for avoiding customer dissatisfaction.

4. Key Drivers of Wine Quality

From feature importance analysis and correlation studies, several variables consistently stood out:

Alcohol — higher levels strongly increase perceived quality.

Volatile acidity — negatively impacts taste and overall rating.

Sulphates and Citric acid — contribute positively to stability and flavor balance.

Residual sugar — moderate influence, affecting sweetness and texture.

These insights align with established established principles, validating both the model and its practical use.

5. Business Impact and Recommendations

This model isn’t just a technical tool — it’s a strategic asset for wine producers.

Quality Consistency: Monitor alcohol, volatile acidity, and sulphates during fermentation to maintain batch consistency.

Early Intervention: Predict low-quality outcomes before bottling and adjust production variables proactively.

Process Optimization: Track key features over time to detect drift in fermentation or ingredient quality.

Market Strategy: Confidently segment wines into quality tiers for optimized pricing and branding.

In short, the model helps producers make smarter, data-backed decisions — improving both product quality and profitability.

6. Deployment

The trained model was deployed via FastAPI, with:

base_url/ — a simple welcome route

base_url/predict — a POST endpoint for single or batch predictions

The system scales easily for integration into winery production software, allowing real-time quality predictions as new batches are analyzed.

7. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of data science in winemaking. By combining thorough data cleaning, robust modeling, and practical deployment, we created a system that not only predicts wine quality accurately but also explains why.

The most influential features — alcohol, volatile acidity, sulphates, and citric acid — give producers clear levers to pull for higher quality and better profit margins. With further calibration and richer data, this model can evolve into a vital component of smart, consistent, and profitable wine production.
